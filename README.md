# coms3200
I used python to write my COMS3200 codes. I could have used Java and C but the lecturer strickly suggested to use only the standard libraries for socket so could not be bothered to create new libraries with Java and C. Python is way easier to do and very flexible.

Important notes: The COMS3200 assignments were quite hard compare to the final exam. I was okay with the assignment and had fun doing them. If you struggle with assignments then don't worry you'll still get a chance to pass the exam.

The assignments Marks I got (coding parts):
A1: 48.5/50,
A2: 42/50,
A3: ..... (not released)
